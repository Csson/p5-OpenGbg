NAME

    OpenGbg - An interface to the Open Data API of Gothenburg

VERSION

    Version 0.1301, released 2015-01-16.

SYNOPSIS

        use OpenGbg;
    
        my $opengbg = OpenGbg->new(key => 'secret-api-key');
    
        $response = $opengbg->styr_och_stall->get_bike_stations;
    
        print $response->stations->get_by_index(0)->to_text;

DESCRIPTION

    OpenGbg is a way to connect to and use the open data published by the
    city of Gothenburg <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothenburg>.

    The open data homepage is located at http://data.goteborg.se/. All
    official documentation is in Swedish, but the license agreement is
    published in English here <https://gbgdata.wordpress.com/goopen/>.

    To use the API you need to get a free api key.

METHOD

 new()

    Takes an optional key-value pair, the key is key and the value your api
    key, see authenticate.

    Returns a OpenGbg::Handler object on which you then call the services.

AUTHENTICATE

    Once you have your api key you can use it in two different ways:

    1. You can give it in the constructor:

        my $opengbg = OpenGbg->new(key => 'secret-api-key');

    2. You can save it in a file named .opengbg.ini in your homedir:

        [API]
        key = secret-api-key

SERVICES

    The following services are currently implemented in this distribution:

    AirQuality - Data on air quality

    Bridge - Data on the openness of Göta Älvbron

    StyrOchStall - Data on rent-a-bike stations

    TrafficCamera - Data on traffic cameras, and their images

NAMING

    Most names related to the services are de-camelized, while others are
    lower-cased (no underscores). For example, the service
    'GetBikeStations' is called like this:

        my $gbg = OpenGbg->new;
        my $stations = $gbg->get_bike_stations;

    All calls to services are prefixed with 'get' even if the service isn't
    named that way. On the other hand, the 'service' suffix on some
    services are removed.

    Date/time intervals are always called 'start' and 'end' (in the web
    services they are sometimes called 'start' and 'stop').

DISCLAIMER

    This is not an official distribution.
