    print $response->stations->get_by_index(0)->to_text;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Styr och st√§ll is Gothenburg's bike share program. This service has a couple of methods to get data about the bike stations.

L<Official documentation|http://data.goteborg.se/Pages/Webservice.aspx?ID=10>

See L<OpenGbg> for general information.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_bike_station($id)

C<$id> is the station id for the station you want to get information about. You'll need to first have fetched the stations with L<get_bike_stations|/"get_bike_stations(%geography)"> to get the ids.

Returns a L<GetBikeStation|OpenGbg::Service::StyrOchStall::GetBikeStation> object.


=head2 get_bike_stations(%geography)

C<%geography> is an optional hash used to limit returned stations to a geographical area.
Its keys are C<lat> and C<long>, and optionally C<radius> (in metres).

If C<%geography> is absent no geographic filtering is done.

Returns a L<GetBikeStations|OpenGbg::Service::StyrOchStall::GetBikeStations> object.

=head1 EXCEPTIONS

If the http call to the web service fails, a L<BadResponseFromService|OpenGbg::Exception::BadResponseFromService> exception is thrown. Use L<Try::Tiny> to catch.
