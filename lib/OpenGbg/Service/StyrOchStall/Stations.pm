=head1 NAME

OpenGbg::Service::StyrOchStall::Stations - A list of Styr och StÃ¤ll stations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $styr_och_stall = OpenGbg->new->styr_och_stall;
    my $service = $styr_och_stall->get_bike_stations;

    printf 'Time: %s', $service->timestamp;
    print $service->stations->get(5)->to_text;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 all

Returns an array of the L<OpenGbg::Service::StyrOchStall::Station> objects in the response.

=head2 count

Returns the number of L<Station|OpenGbg::Service::StyrOchStall::Station> objects in the response.

=head2 filter(sub { ... })

Allows filtering of the stations. Takes a sub routine reference, into which all L<Station|OpenGbg::Service::StyrOchStall::Station> objects are
passed one-by-one into C<$_>. Works like C<grep>.

=head2 get($index)

Gets the n:th L<OpenGbg::Service::StyrOchStall::Station> object in the response. Do note that this is B<not> the station id. For that you
would use:

    my $wanted_station = $stations->filter(sub { $_->id == $wanted_id });

=head2 map(sub { ... })

Like C<filter> it takes a sub routine reference and passes each L<Station|OpenGbg::Service::StyrOchStall::Station> as C<$_>. Eg, to get a total count of free bikes:

    use List::AllUtils 'sum';
    my $free_bikes_count = sum $service->stations->map( sub { $_->free_bikes });


=head2 sort(sub { ... })

Like C<filter> it takes a sub routine reference. It works just like C<sort> except the two L<Station|OpenGbg::Service::StyrOchStall::Station> objects to compare are passed as C<$_[0]> and C<$_[1]>
